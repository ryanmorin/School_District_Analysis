# School_District_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The analysis is being done on behalf of our client; Maria.  Maria is a representative of the school board.  The school board suspects cheating on a state standardized test. They believe that the cheating is localize to a grade level at one of its schools.  Maria has requested that we remove the math and reading scores for grade 9 and recalculate the new average math and reading scores for the remaining grade levels. Once complete we will recreate the previous school district analysis with the new scores.

## Results
The impact of removing the effected grade level at Thomas High School had the following impact:
- The School Summary saw a very small change to the overall passing % (pre-change = 90.9% vs. post-change = 90.6%)
- Overall the district grades were impacted nominally.  Both math and reading grades remained the same to one decimal point.
- The overall ranking of the school remained unchanged - The school was still considered the second best school in the district
- Replacing the ninth grade scores has the following impact:
  - The average score for grade 9 math students decreased by 0.2% and the average reading score decreased by 0.1%
  - It has no impact on scores by school spending to one decimal place
  - It has no impact on scores by school size to one decimal place
  - It has no impact on scores by school type to one decimal place

## Summary
Overall there was little or no change to the overall averages.  The following are the four most notable changes:
1. The average score for grade 9 math students decreased by 0.2% across the district after the adjustment
2. The average reading score for grade 9 students decreased by 0.1% across the district post adjustment
3. The overall passing % decreased by 0.3% after the adjustment
